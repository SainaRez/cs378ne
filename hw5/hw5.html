        <h1>Homework 2: COVID-19 Policy Prescriptions</h1>
        <p><b>Due date:</b> October 1, 11:59 p.m.</p>
        <p><b>Questions:</b> Post to Piazza.</p>
        <p><b>Format:</b> Jupyter notebook / written report.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In this homework, you will train a COVID-19 policy prescriptor using <a
                href="https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?neat">NEAT</a>. The prescriptor generates a plan that defines which
            policies will be in effect over a period of time. The plan is evaluated on two criteria: (1) the predicted
            number of <b>cases</b> given the interventions prescribed and (2) the <b>stringency</b> of the
            interventions.</p>

        <p>Success is about balance between stringency and cases. Your model will output a number of different
            proposals, which ideally habitate different regions on the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">Pareto frontier</a>. A policy plan is better than
            another if it has the same or fewer predicted cases and is either the same or less stringent.</p>

        <p>In this homework, you will use one that has been pretrained. The file
            <code>examples/lstm/trained_model.h5</code> represents an LSTM predictor model. It can be invoked by
            <code>predict.py</code>, as you will see in the example. It can also be instantiated directly.
        </p>

        <p><b>This assignment is longer and more open-ended than Homework 1. Be sure to allocate enough time.</b></p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>1. Download the code and dependencies</h3>
        <h4>Download the code and switch to the assignment branch</h4>
        <p>The code is available on GitHub. The original repository is <a
                href="https://github.com/leaf-ai/covid-xprize">here</a>, though a fork has been updated to work with the
            latest data <a href="https://github.com/SainaRez/covid-xprize-cs378ne.git">here</a>. You may
            download it with the following commands:
            <br><code>git clone https://github.com/SainaRez/covid-xprize-cs378ne.git <br>
    cd covid-xprize-cs378ne <br>
    </code>
        </p>

        <!--
    <p>If you have downloaded the code earlier, you can run the following to get the most recent version:<br>
    <code>git checkout prescriptor-assignment <br>
    git pull</code></p>
    -->

        <h4>Install the dependencies</h4>
        <code>
    conda create --name cs378ne_hw5 python=3.10.4 <br>
    conda activate cs378ne_hw5 <br>
    pip install -r requirements.txt</code></p>
        <!-- If you're on MAC, you can use the <code>requirements_macos.txt</code> file instead. <br> -->
        <!-- <p>The example depends on NEAT, which you may install like so: <br>
    <code>pip3 install neat-python==0.92</code></p>
    Please follow instructions at <a href="hw2-f24/installation.txt">steps-to-install-env-f24.txt</a>. -->

        <h4>Set up the environment</h4>
        <p>Starting in your <code>covid-xprize-cs378ne</code> directory, run the following to point your
            PYTHONPATH to the application code:<br>
            <code>export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`</code>
        </p>

        <p>Now checkout the assignment branch <br>
            <code>git checkout prescriptor-assignment</code>
        </p>

        <p>Also, copy the sample LSTM model into the appropriate directory:<br>
            <code>mkdir -p examples/predictors/lstm/models &&
    cp examples/predictors/lstm/tests/fixtures/trained_model_weights_for_tests.h5 examples/predictors/lstm/models/trained_model_weights.h5</code>
        </p>

        <h3>2. Read the example</h3>
        <p>Change into the example code directory:<br>
            <code>cd examples/prescriptors/neat/</code>
        </p>
        <p>Then, read the file <code>train_prescriptor.py</code>. It contains a sample model and training procedure
            using NEAT. You will need to run it to train and save the sample prescriptor model.</p>

        <p>Try running the code with the following command:<br>
            <code>python train_prescriptor.py</code>
        </p>
        Examine the code to understand:
        <ul>
            <li>What is the format and shape of the input data to the prescriptor?</li>
            <li>What is the output of the prescriptor?</li>
            <li>How are the predicted number of new cases and the stringency calculated?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There is another file located <code>prescribe.py</code>. You can evaluate it with the following sample
            command:<br>
            <code>python3 prescribe.py --start_date 2020-08-01 --end_date 2020-08-05 -ip none.txt -o test_prescriptions.csv</code>
        </p>

        <p>Read <code>prescribe.py</code> to understand how the output of the prescriptor model is formatted as a CSV
            file. Several prescriptors indexed by PrescriptionIndex are saved to the output CSV file, and in this
            example, they correspond to the model checkpoints saved at intervals throughout training. You may reuse this
            code in the next steps.</p>

        <h3>3. Change fitness for training into weighted sum formulation</h3>
        <p> We have a multi-goal problem setting that we need to consider both making daily cases small and making
            policy not too stringent. One simple approach is to combine two goals into one single objective function by
            using weighted sum and setting different weights for these two goals. </p>

        <p> Your job is to implement weighted sum fitness function and play with different weight coefficient settings
            in <code>train_prescriptor.py</code>. A simple starting point is to use two constants, i.e. on multiplying
            the number of cases objectve and the other the stringency objective. Train on different coefficients to
            generate multiple proposals (you can just revise file <code>train_prescriptor.py</code> for simplicity).
            Save the model checkpoint file which will be used to generate the CSV files. You need to run the file
            <code>prescribe.py</code> to generate CSV file, but be sure to make model checkpoint file path consistent.
            You need to generate 10 different proposed prescriptors, e.g. 10, each with different coefficients. Then
            generate the the corresponding NPI schedules (CSV file) for later evaluation.
        </p>

        <!-- <h3>4. Select and implement an evolutionary search algorithm</h3>
        <p>In this step, you will implement your own prescriptor model. You may use any search library of your choice.
            The sample, <code>train_prescriptor.py</code> finds a good model using NEAT. You will reuse the code from
            the file which evaluates the objective functions on the prescriptions, but you will replace the parts that
            use NEAT, i.e., the lines 169 and beyond.</p>
        <p>Recall that the task is, given an input sequence of intervention policies and case data, to output a sequence
            of intervention policies. The model should output a CSV file as in <code>prescribe.py</code>.</p>

        <p>You are meant to scrap the NEAT implementation found at the bottom of <code>train_prescriptor.py</code>.
            Then, replace this with a search algorithm of your choice. As a basic example, you might try replacing NEAT
            with HyperNEAT or a genetic algorithm, which is easy since these algorithms have the same signature as NEAT,
            i.e., they don't require backpropagation. But there are many possible algorithms. You might want to revisit
            the decision making readings for inspiration.</p> -->


        <h3>4. (Optional and bonus)</h3>
        <p> To follow up, you can also design other forms of the weights and fitness functions. Just try and play with
            it. Even more advanced, there are a few ways to optimize in a multi-objective setting, such as NSGA2 or
            MOEA/D. You are free to set the fitness function as multi-objective functions and play with it. Really good
            answer will get 10 more points.</p>

        <h3>5. Evaluate and visualize different prescriptors</h3>
        <p>The file <code>prescriptor_robojudge.ipynb</code> contains evaluation routines. Point an element of the
            <code>prescription_files</code> dictionary to the output CSV file of your prescription model. If you have
            completed the above steps, you should see an L-shaped curve representing the Pareto frontier. To get better
            grades, you should try to come up with sets of coefficients so that the L-shaped curve is as close to the
            axes and the origin, as possible, that is, such that the solutions minimize the tradeoffs between cases and
            stringency as well as possible. You may compare different results using this method (in case that you do
            step 4).
